# Classification of Image Data

## Overview
This project implements and evaluates a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) and a Convolutional Neural Network (ConvNet) for classifying image data from the Fashion-MNIST dataset.

## Dataset
The project uses the Fashion-MNIST dataset, which includes training and test sets.

## Implementation
### Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)
- Implemented from scratch, including backpropagation and mini-batch gradient descent.
### Convolutional Neural Network (ConvNet)
- Implementation using libraries like PyTorch.

## Experimentation
- MLP configurations: no hidden layer, one hidden layer, two hidden layers.
- Impact of L2 regularization and unnormalized images.
- ConvNet implementation and comparison with MLPs.
- Hyperparameter and network architecture experimentation.
